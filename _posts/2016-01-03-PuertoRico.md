This winter break, I went on a 7 day trip in the Carribean. I began (and ended) in Puerto Rico, but visited multiple outlying islands.

I thoroughly enjoyed hiking through El Yunque, a rainforest near San Juan. I got a cool peek of a lone palm tree atop a hill.

We hired a tour guide (Andres from Atabey Tours) who brought us to the national park (El Yunque) as well as a private part of the rainforest, where we were able to swim in a river and stand under a waterfall. Andres was super cool- he hiked the entire way barefoot, picked up trash, and showed us medicinal plants in the rainforest.

The scenery here is best enjoyed from a rope swing.

We stopped for lunch at a crowded restaurant inside the park. These were some wonderful rice and beans! The rice was cooked perfectly- each grain was moist and full without becoming mushy and indistinct.

Our first stop was in St. Thomas, still U.S. territory (praise the 4G). We spent the day at the beach where we swam and did breathing exercises (because why not?)

Check out the view through these trees!

St. Croix was pretty boring to be honest. We ended up enjoying 4G on the ship most of the day, but we did find this groaner of a name.

Antigua (often mentioned along with its neighbor Barbuda) is pronounced 'Antiga' by most people in the Carribean. Lots of catamarans floating around the ports (reminds me of the Wookie catamarans in Star Wars...)

There were some awesome views though. That island looks a lot like a crocodile, doesn't it? Also note all the expensive yachts floating around. There was a definite wealth disparity between most of the towns and some secluded vacation homes.

St. Lucia was probably my favorite island (not counting Puerto Rico). We took a van tour around the entire island basically. Note: In St. Lucia, like Antigua and other former British colonies, people drive on the *left*!

A landing strip on the island.

A banana grove. The blue bags are to keep bugs and birds away. Fun fact: banana plants (they're not trees!) only bear one crop of fruit! After that, they're chopped down and provide nutrients for the new shoots.

We were offered (and politely declined) the opportunity to take a hot mud bath. Instead, we watched from a distance.

A pretty little boat docked in the harbor.

A pelican atop a post.

Here's the port in Grenada. Colorful rooftops are a favorite of mine.

Back in Puerto Rico, we rented a van and explored Old San Juan. It's almost like Spain! (at least that's what my friend who's been to Spain said...)

I love cobblestone streets (though they make for bumpy rides...)

<img alt="Photo: Street" src="http://brianmlin.com/Images/PuertoRico/street.jpg" style="max-width:630px;">

Old San Juan (as a port city) has two forts. You can easily walk between them and the downtown area (in fact you can see one fort from the other). 

<img alt="Photo: Fort" src="http://brianmlin.com/Images/PuertoRico/fort.jpg" style="max-width:630px;">

There's a beautiful plain in front of one of the forts. Many kids were flying kits in the wind.

Here's an artsy photo from inside a tower.

As proof of Puerto Rico being a U.S. territory, check out this Post Office and box!

This place reminds me of China- plenty of old folk playing cards and dominoes in the park.

A tall building downtown.

And that's it for this time!

Oh wait- bonus weasel...
