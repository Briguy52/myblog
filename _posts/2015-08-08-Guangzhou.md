Guangzhou (广州) is the third largest city in China, after Beijing and Shanghai. It is located in the south of China and the primary language is Cantonese Chinese.

The photo above shows a stadium located next to the Guangzhou Tower (广州塔). Its reflection reminds me of a wing or fin.

Guangzhou is hot and humid. It's 闷热 - so stifling hot that a shower is needed after walking around outdoors. You'll see clothes hung out to dry on the balconies- this is a dorm at South China Normal University (华师大学) where I stayed for some weeks (check out that blue sky though!)

I love the food in Guangzhou, dim sum (飲茶) especially. There's also steamed fish, roasted pork and duck, and fresh lychee- all favorite foods.

At night, the city is all lights. Lots of people walking around as couples or with their kids.
