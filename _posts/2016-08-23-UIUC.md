I spent a couple days in Champaign-Urbana this August visiting friends, cooking, and looking off balconies. Here's dusk from the 11th floor of my friend's balcony on Green Street.

Speaking of, Green Street is where you'll find most of the restaurants and shops.

I had the opportunity to try 2 local bubble tea shops, Chatime and Latea. I have to say I was impressed by both, mainly due to the great selection (including the usually-absent grass jelly that I so enjoy). Really wish we had a shop like that on or around campus in Durham.

Sunday was 'Quad Day', basically a co-curricular fair on the main quad where all the clubs, student orgs, IM sports, and frats/sororities set up booths to attract new members.

Got some free stuff, bumped into a lot of old friends, and got to peek at the architecture.

Here's the Altgeld Hall bell tower, which plays various songs and chimes throughout the day, similar to our Duke Chapel.
