I spent a couple days in Champaign-Urbana this August visiting friends, cooking, and looking off balconies.

Here's dusk from the 11th floor of my friend's apartment on Green Street.

Speaking of, Green Street is where you'll find most of the restaurants and shops.

I had the opportunity to try 2 local bubble tea shops, Chatime and Latea. I have to say I was impressed by both, mainly due to the great selection (including the usually-absent grass jelly that I so enjoy). Really wish we had a shop like that on or around campus in Durham.

Sunday was 'Quad Day', basically a co-curricular fair on the main quad where all the clubs, student orgs, IM sports, and frats/sororities set up booths to attract new members.

Got some free stuff, bumped into a lot of old friends, and got to look at some buildings.

Here's the Altgeld Hall bell tower, which plays various songs and chimes throughout the day, similar to our Duke Chapel.

I love the sneaky addition of Redbull cans to the Alma Mater statue.

Back to my friends' place. It's fantastic. Gaming PCs setup everywhere but still everything's really neat. Wish I could live here!

One friend recently came back from Korea and brought along these really neat Star Wars paper models that we built. Got to rediscover how annoyingly un-sticky glue sticks are.

These come in different sizes (smaller ones are harder to put together). Here's Grievous and a StormTrooper.

An in-progress Vader. I love the detail that goes into these. The company that makes these is called MOMOT. You can find their website [here](http://momot.co.kr/portfolio-item/starwars-vol-1/).

And that's it! Many thanks to Chris, Will, Eric, Jimmy, Ray, Jae, Tony, and Sunny for a great couple days.
