A late afternoon sunset over the neighborhoods north of East Campus in Durham.

Pink and orange streaks in the sky above the Biddle Music building on Duke East Campus, Durham.

One of the Keohane quad bridges, stretching over some red leaves below.

Over the semester, my facult-in-residence family, Prof. Hwansoo Kim and Sumi Loudon Kim, hosted many 'Snack Attacks' over at their apartment. (I'm still searching for a Mango Lassi recipe that rivals theirs...) Over Thanksgiving Break, they kindly had students over for brunch, which included some playtime with their cats!

As part of House Council, I helped organize some well-received food events, such as 'Dessert Night'. Check out these oreo and cookie cupcakes!

My dorm at sunset. Looks a lot like the silhouette of a castle, huh?

McClendon tower. Many long and late nights were spent working on CompSci assignments here, fueled by coffee and wafers from Bella Union.

This year a new video game center opened up on campus, complete with 10 PC's, a Wii, and multiple PS4s and Xbox Ones. Over Thanksgiving break, Austin and I attempted to finish the story of Borderlands: The Presequel.

Paul's Pelikan M400 Souveran fountain pen in white tortoise with a Broad nib. Man, what a pen! Looks beautiful, fits just right into your hand, and -of course- is smooth beyond belief.

One thing I like to do is build mechanical keyboards. I start by thinking about what size board I want- full size with arrow keys and numpad or perhaps something smaller and more portable. My latest build is what’s called a ‘Planck’. It’s a 4 x 12 grid of unstaggered keys which is super compact and perfect for tucking into a backpack. After deciding on a layout, I choose my switches. You can get clicky ones (that may drive friends and co-workers crazy), silent and super light switches designed for gaming, and everything in between. These switches are then arranged in a matrix with diodes and wires, which are then connected to a Teensy microcontroller that is flashed with the actual firmware. This entire setup fits inside a case I laser cut out of acrylic (complete with engraved Stormtrooper helmet on the bottom). The last step involves adding keycaps and testing the board out! Of course, I forgot to mention the hours of hardware debugging with multimeter in hand, checking every single connection to find the source of the inevitable bugs (‘I’ key returning ‘J’s for example). But it’s well worth it in the end!

I've spent countless hours loitering around the Innovation Co-Lab, 3D printing and laser cutting all sorts of things. They recently got 20 or more new Ultimaker 2s- some of the sweetest 3D printers I've ever used.

These things run for a couple thousand each...

The suburbs are a beautiful place, telephone wires and all. (The blue sky helps too)

Walking back to my dorm with the sun in the sky.

A lasercut topo map made by my outdoorsy friend Addison.

The sun peeking through some trees between Edens and Keohane quads.

'Friendsgiving' in the dorm this year. Great food and (minimal) food burning.

Actually one of the best turkeys I've ever had! We cooked it ourselves.

Some violet flowers outside.

An orange dusk over the East Campus tennis courts.

That's it for 2015! See you in a bit.
