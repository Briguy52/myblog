<p>Hot air balloon rides on East Campus! What a day!</p>

<p>It’s powered by one giant flamethrower (gotta love the reaction of all the people around me when he first turned it on… screams, shouts, and steps back haha).</p>

<p>And the view from the top- East Campus quad, Baldwin side. We didn’t go that high up, but rising above Lily Library and seeing the setting sun splash its light over the roof- breathtaking!</p>
