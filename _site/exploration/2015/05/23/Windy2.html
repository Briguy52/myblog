<p>I completed my first week of work at Clair Vista, LLC in Chicago. Here’s the view looking North from the Kinzie Street Bridge. Beautiful blue sky.</p>

<p>I then head south along Canal Street on the walk back to Union Station and I came across a familiar railroad crossing often seen from the window of the Metra. This is on Canal Street heading south.</p>

<p>Within an hour, the North Central Service takes me back up north to the Prairie View Station.</p>

<p>There’s nothing quite like an American flag.</p>

<p>Over the course of the week, I got some great experience with Python, Sphinx, reStructuredText, and being a part of a great software development team. This will be a great summer!</p>
