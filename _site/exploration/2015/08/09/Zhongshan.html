<p>Zhongshan (中山) is a city in the south of China. It’s a 45 minute bullet train (高铁) ride from Guangzhou’s main train station.</p>

<p>The downtown area is clustered with electronics shops and all sorts of inflatable advertisements. Go beyond the downtown area and you can find thick mazes of small gray houses.</p>

<p>I also visited the nearby Sun Yat-Sen High School. This places looks unreal! It’s like the backdrop of a Japanese high school drama or anime.</p>

<p>There’s a random boat in the pond!</p>

<p>Lots and lots of green here.</p>

<p>There’s quite a lot of lotus ponds nearby. The place we visited also offered Chinese bananas. They’re still yellow, but a lot chubbier than those found in U.S. supermarkets. The flavor was similar, but had a much fuller, tangy taste that reminded me of papaya almost.</p>
